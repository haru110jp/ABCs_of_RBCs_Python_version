# ABCs_of_RBSs_Python_version
I write Python versions of MATLAB codes appearing in "The ABCs of RBCs" by George McCandless. The structure of the program may be slightly changed from the original one, but I make sure that almost the same result is obtained.

I believe my Python codes are helpful for those who do not have an access to MATLAB.


Four (Personal) Objectives:

1. To improve my skills of numerical calculations/simulations. 

2. To learn how to figure out MATLAB codes. 

3. To recall how to use Python ( I've not used it for nearly a year.). 

4. To have a deeper understanding about dynamic models.
