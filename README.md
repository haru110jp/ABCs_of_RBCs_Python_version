# ABCs_of_RBSs_Python_version
I write Python versions of MATLAB codes appearing in "The ABCs of RBCs" by George McCandless.\\
I believe my Python codes are helpful for those who do not have an access to MATLAB.


Four (personal) Objectives
1. To improve my skills about numerical calculations/simulations. \\
2. To learn how to figure out MATLAB codes. \\
3. To recall how to use Python ( I've not used it for nearly a year.). \\
4. To have a deeper understanding about dynamic models
